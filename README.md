# Code Refactor

## The purpose of this project is to Refactor the code on a website.

The motivation behind this project was, as a marketing agency i want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our site is optimized for search engines. 

I have build this project because people need to have extra features in place for their personal accessabilty needs. 

I want everyone who visits the webpage to be able to surf effectively. In doing this, it solves the problem of people having to encounter issues whilst on the webpage.

In this project i learned how to make my code elements semantic and follow a logical structure. I also learned how to created attributes which allow better access throughout the webpage.
